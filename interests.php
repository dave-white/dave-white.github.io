    <h1>Interests</h1>
    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p>On my <a href="https://github.com/dave-white">GitHub account</a> I have a couple public projects:
      <ul>
	<li>A <a href="https://github.com/dave-white/vim-latex">fork</a> of the <code><a href="https://github.com/vim-latex/vim-latex">vim-latex</a></code> plugin. The idea here&mdash;still in progress&mdash;is to allow the user to specify plugin parameters on a per-project or per-file basis and to have the plugin's functionality play nicely with the use of some of the parameters for <code>pdflatex</code></li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/dave-white/dave-white.github.io">This website</a>. I coded this retrograde-looking thing "by hand" in HTML and PHP.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>On my personal PC I run <a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a>, my terminal emulator of choice is <a href="https://st.suckless.org"><code>st</code></a>, and my browser is <a><code>qutebrowser</code></a>. At some point I'd like to alter <code>qutebrowser</code> so that local files can be read through the user's choice of intermediate program, and so as to use the <code>gopher</code> protocol. I've done the former in a single use case and in a hacky way, running Markdown through <code>pandoc</code> to render it into HTML.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <h2>Mathematics</h2>
    <p>I have the ambition of getting around to planning a course along the lines of <i>Mathematics for the Social Sciences</i>, with the aim of exposing humanities students to the fundamentals of social choice theory and individual strategy/game theory with an emphasis on historical development.
