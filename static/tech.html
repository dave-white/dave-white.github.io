<h1>Science and technology</h1>

<p>Currently reading <a href="https://theartofhpc.com/"><i>The Art of High Performance Computing</i></a> by <a

	Eijkhout</a>.  Throughout 2024 I privately consulted on debugging implementations of 
numerical linear algebra experiments in MATLAB and Fortran, using OpenMP for 
parallelization and running on a high-performance computing cluster at a major 
research institution.  That experience, along with reviewing related 
mathematical computing utilizing CUDA, prompted me to undertake more formal 
learning in this area.

<p>I performed some tutorials and unguided projects in machine learning with 
TensorFlow and scikit-learn in 2023, and I plan to review some more theoretical 
literature after completing the above.
