<h2>Current projects</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Developing new features in my forks of <a href="https://github.com/Ripser/ripser">Ripser</a>, a C++ program for
		computing
		persistent
		homology (see e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00738">Carlsson</a> or

<h2>Learning</h2>

<p>Currently reading <a href="https://theartofhpc.com/"><i>The Art of High Performance Computing</i></a> by <a
	href="https://tacc.utexas.edu/about/staff-directory/victor-eijkhout/"> Victor
	Eijkhout</a>.  Throughout 2024 I privately consulted on debugging implementations of 
numerical linear algebra experiments in MATLAB and Fortran, using OpenMP for 
parallelization and running on a high-performance computing cluster at a major 
research institution.  That experience, along with reviewing related 
mathematical computing utilizing CUDA, prompted me to undertake more formal 
learning in this area.
