<h1>Topology</h1>

<h2>Current activities</h2>

<p>Studying Vidit Nanda's <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/nanda/">lecture notes</a> on computational algebraic
	topology. Having already some familiarity with topological data analysis, I would like to follow this up with an
	investigation into developing applications of algebraic topology to machine learning. </p>

<h2>Doctoral work</h2>

<p>My doctoral research, conducted under the invaluable direction of my advisor,
	<a href="https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/tlid/home">Tye Lidman</a>, focused
	on low-dimensional manifold topology and knot theory, and especially on the
	applications of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floer_homology">Floer theory,</a> in
	these fields. A major motivation of my work is the Atiyah-Floer conjecture,
	holding roughly that each instanton Floer homology should have an isomorphic
	Lagrangian Floer counterpart. My <a href="https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/resolver/1840.20/40897">dissertation</a>
	constructs a Lagrangian Floer homology invariant of knots/links in
	3-manifolds via traceless character varieties and studies its connection to
	Kronheimer &amp; Mrowka's instanton knot homology.

	complementing this current research with fundamental background, I've reviewed <a

		href="https://www.math.uci.edu/~chenlong/226/FMMsimple.pdf">articles</a> on the fast multipole method (FMM) and hope
	to survey more on matrix compression/interpolative decomposition (ID).</p>
