# _Curriculum Vitae_

## Research

My area of research includes low-dimensional manifold topology and 
symplectic geometry, in particular Floer-type homologies. I am interested 
in applications of the latter to constructing invariants of knots and 
links, and in many variations on the Atiyah-Floer conjecture.

## Education

-  **North Carolina State University** (NC State): Ph.D. candidate, 
   Mathematics, _ongoing_

-  **Duke University**: B.A., Philosophy, 2011
