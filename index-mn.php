<h2>About me</h2>

<?php include 'grad-yrs-calc.php'; ?>

<p>I am a <?php echo $str_yr_dur_ord; ?> year PhD student in the <a href="https://math.sciences.ncsu.edu">Department of Mathematics</a> at North Carolina State University (NC State).</p>

<p>
  My studies are in the areas of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-dimensional_topology">low-dimensional manifold topology</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry">symplectic geometry</a>, especially the applications of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floer_homology">Floer theory</a>. I am particularly interested in carrying out research into:
  <ul>
    <li>the construction of Floer-homological relative invariants for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(mathematics)">knots</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_(knot_theory)">links</a>, as well as</li>
    <li>variations on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floer_homology#Atiyahâ€“Floer_conjecture">Atiyah-Floer conjecture</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  See my <a href="research">Research</a> page for more details.
</p>

<p>My advisor is <a href="https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/tlid/home">Tye Lidman</a>, under whose invaluable direction I have worked since 2019.

<p>I obtained by B.A. from <a href="https://duke.edu/">Duke University</a> in 2011, majoring in philosophy and mathematics. Afterward I was employed as a software developer for several years before returning to academia in 2017. I continue, however, to nuture a casual enthusiasm for programming. A few of my endeavors at this are to be found on my <a href="interests">Interests</a> page.</p>
